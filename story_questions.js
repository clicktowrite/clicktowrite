Green growth policies aim to take advantage of any new policies that result in continued economic development __Blank1__ preserving natural resources and reversing climate change. The principles behind __Blank2__ goals include moving toward a cleaner and more sustainable production and modifying consumption patterns. This transition to greener growth models is not __Blank3__ easy. Often, governments and financial institutions are required to make significant adjustments to their policies. New environmental regulations may be painful and costly to societies and __Blank4__ meet with opposition from citizen groups and corporations.
