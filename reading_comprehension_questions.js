            "title": "Economic Downfall",
            "passage": "Probably the best-known economic catastrophe in the last century, the Great Depression, was a lengthy period of economic decline that followed in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929. This depression was felt worldwide as international trade collapsed and deflation soared. It took 25 years for the stock market to recover. Later in 1989, America's savings and loan institutions, originally created to provide mortgage loans to potential homeowners, began to fail after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. because S&LS had to pay more interest on deposits than their return on the fixed-rate, lower-interest loans they held, substantial losses for the S&Ls occurred, making repayment difficult for businesses. After this, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act was created in order to rescue the savings and loan industry. Billions of dollars were provided in 1989, which amounted to one of the most expensive government bailouts in history. Since then, other bailouts have helped businesses and individuals recover their losses. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, multi-trillion dollar bailouts helped keep the world's economy stable.",

            "passage": "A lot of people prefer to work in companies with less than fifty employees. These companies are classified as 'small businesses' not only because they have fewer employees, but because they earn relatively small annual revenues. Other considerations used to describe small businesses include logistical methods, sales figures and gross or net revenues. People who run small businesses, such as bakers, shopkeepers, hair stylists or suppliers selling tools and electrical equipment are often sole proprietors. These business owners run retail operations or offer services, such as web design or print or photography studios. Professional practices, including those run by doctors, lawyers or accountants, may also qualify as small businesses. Small businesses vary a great deal in terms of size, revenues, and regulatory authorization. For example, running a home accounting business may only require a business license. Other small businesses, such as day care facilities or restaurants serving alcohol, may be more heavily regulated or require governmental inspections and certifications.After spending time working for a large corporation, some people may find starting one's own small business a viable option.",

            "title": "Start-up Companies",
            "passage": "The term start-up refers to a company whose founders hope to make their business viable at some point in the future. Start-ups are created by individuals who recognize the demand for a new product or service but may not have enough capital to cover the initial costs of starting a business. These entrepreneurs generally start with high costs and limited revenue. Therefore, funding has to be acquired from a variety of sources, such as family, friends and venture capitalists. Unfortunately, many start-ups don't make it due to inadequate planning. For example, many don't have a fully developed business model or enough capital to move onto the next phase of business. Since most of these companies are initially funded by their founders, they rely on seed capital or crowd funding to supplement their business expenditures. Research and the development of a business plan are considered key elements for a start-up's success. Market research, for example, can help determine the actual demand for a product or service, while a comprehensive business plan that outlines the company's mission statement, visions and goals, as well as management and marketing strategies can help entrepreneurs keep a start-up business going in the long term.",
